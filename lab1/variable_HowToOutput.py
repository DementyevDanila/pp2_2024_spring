x = "I love Python"
print(x)

x = "I"
y = "love"
z = "Python"
print(x, y, z)

x = "I "
y = "love " # space after "love " and "I " is important, because without thems answer wil be IlovePython
z = "Python"
print(x + y + z)

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

x = 1
y = "Alexander"
# print(y + x) inpossible. because y and x have the different types of data

#but this method will give us what we expect
print (y, x)
